# AdPilot

An AI advertising agency app. Customers describe what they want to promote. AdPilot stores the business, interprets the brief, and (in later phases) generates ads.

Phase 1–2 in this tree: accounts, business profiles, conversational briefs. No Runway or paid media calls.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
env -u DATABASE_URL npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000

When `DATABASE_URL` is unset the app uses PGlite (file-backed under `data/pglite`). Production Postgres is provisioned on publish via `cursor-app.json`.

Optional:

- `ADMIN_EMAILS` — comma-separated administrator emails (never auto-promotes the first user)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — optional LLM interpretation; without it a structured conversation engine is used

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — development server
- `npm run build` — Next.js build, then `scripts/migrate.mjs` when `DATABASE_URL` is set
